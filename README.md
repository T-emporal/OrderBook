# Temporal 
Temporal Orderbook Simulation

## Introduction

Temporalâ€™s market mechanism unifies Temporally Discrete Markets such as Futures and
Lending & Borrowing into Realtime, Continuous, Forward Curves shaped purely by market
forces. This allows users to enter Market-Priced, Custom-Maturity Futures and Lending &
Borrowing contracts, creating an entirely new DeFi primitive; in contrast to typical
exchanges which offer a few standardized-maturity contracts with siloed liquidity.

This repository aims to provide Temproal's OrderBook Simulation/Prototype 

## Prerequisites

- Golang (1.19 or higher)

## Getting Started 
- Clone this Rrpository
- Run code through `go run main.go`

## Code Walk-Through
- Simulation has already been stored with initial Offers and Bids which could be displayed to execute Trade
- Initially when we intiate Simulation it gives options with key `2` and `4` to add more Offers and Bids, also we can see all Offers and Bids with key `1` and `3` for both pre and post trade
- When Executing Trade with key `5` we can see the Order Matching Mechanisum. For every Bid ID we could see which all offer ID is matched and trade taken place. Total Quantity, Price and Amount is showed for every Bid ID
- A plot is drawn, against Price and Duration which shows the Continuous, Forward Curves shaped purely by market forces, which could seen in the working directory as `out.png`
